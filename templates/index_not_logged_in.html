	Emojinsei is a smart emotion tracking app.  
	</br></br>
	Emotions are the fabric of life.  They color how I see the world and how I interact with others.
	</br></br>
	You'll sign up on the webpage, but immediately you'll start to recieve text messages that asks you about your experience with specific emotions.  
	</br></br>
	All you have to do is respond to the text messages with number between 0 and 10.
	</br></br>
	We hope that this will provide you with:
	<li>a periodic reminder to just pay attention to this wonderful world and </li>
	<li>data about how you experience emotions</li>
	</br>
	Emojinsei is based upon statistical principles.  We hope to provide with you valid inferences about your emotional life.  But, more than this, we hope to be able to understand this world more fully and use this data for social change.  
	</br></br>
	If you ever need a break, just text 'stop'.
